**What is Next.js?**
Next.js is a React framework for building web applications.

**React.js**

-> It's not feasible to create a fully-featured application ready for production
-> React is a library for building user interfaces.
-> You need to make decisions about other features such as routing, data fetching
and more

**Next.js**
→ It uses React for building user interfaces
→ Provides additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications
→ These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling,
compiling, and more
→ You don't need to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything you
need
→ Opinions and conventions should be followed to implement these features

**Why learn Next.js?**
Next.js simplifies the process of building a web application for production

1. Routing (File based routing)
2. API routes (backend)
3. Rendering (CSR, SSR)
4. Data fetching (async / await in react components)
5. Styling (CSS nodules, Tailwing)
6. Optimization (Image, fonts, scripts)
7. Dev and prod build system (Turbo pack)
