### Routing:

-> Next.js has a file-system based routing mechanism
-> URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase

### Routing Conventions

-> All routes must be placed inside the app folder
-> Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx
-> Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL
-> profile/page.tsx component will be available at route /profile
-> about/page.tsx component will be available at route /about
